# Knowledge Distillation Configuration
# Auto-generates cross-chunk aggregated knowledge during cognify to improve retrieval precision.
# This eliminates the need for manually created supplementary knowledge files.

distillation:
  # Enable/disable knowledge distillation in the cognify pipeline
  enabled: true

  # Maximum characters per LLM distillation call
  # Documents exceeding this limit are processed hierarchically (map-reduce)
  # ~4 chars/token, so 24000 chars ≈ 6000 tokens
  context_char_limit: 24000

  # Types of knowledge distillation to generate
  # Remove items from this list to skip specific types
  types:
    - enumeration      # Complete lists, categories, numbered items
    - aggregation      # Key numbers, quantities, thresholds, versions
    - disambiguation   # Clarify easily confused concepts
    - negation         # Important information NOT in the document
    - qa               # Question-answer pairs for common queries
